# The potential distributions of seven sympatric oak species in the Hengduan Mountains of Southwest China: The importance of climatic, non-climatic and spatial drivers

## Description

[Variation partitioning](https://github.com/optiforziyan/Oak_Liao_et_al_2020_AFS/tree/master/Variation%20partitioning) 
for the predicted habitat suitability simulated by our ensemble models in terms of fractions of variation explained. Variation of the species data matrix is explained by three groups of explanatory variables: CLIM (climatic predictors), NCLIM (non-climatic predictors) and SPAT (spatial predictors).

Note:
