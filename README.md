# The potential distributions of seven sympatric oak species in the Hengduan Mountains of Southwest China: The importance of climatic vs. non-climatic drivers

## Description

The [distribution occurrences](https://github.com/optiforziyan/Liao-et-al-2019/blob/master/Abies_spp_rarefy_rarefied_points.csv) of each *Abies* species were obtained from the following four sources:

(1) the Chinese Virtual Herbarium (CVH, http://www.cvh.ac.cn/);

(2) Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, http://www.gbif.org/); 

(3) field surveys (21 records); 

(4) published literature (see Appendix S1 in the [supplemental files](https://github.com/optiforziyan/Liao-et-al-2019/blob/master/Literature%20contains%20Abies%20distribution%20data.md))
