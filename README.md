# Potential distributions of seven sympatric sclerophyllous oak species in Mountains of Southwest China depend on climatic, non-climatic and independent spatial drivers

## Description

(a) [Variation partitioning](https://github.com/optiforziyan/Oak_Liao_et_al_2020_AFS/tree/master/Variation%20partitioning) 
for the predicted habitat suitability simulated by the ensemble models in terms of fractions of variation explained. Variation of the species data matrix is explained by three groups of explanatory variables: CLIM (climatic predictors), NCLIM (non-climatic predictors) and SPAT (spatial predictors).

Note:
[The Excel document](https://github.com/optiforziyan/Oak_Liao_et_al_2020_AFS/blob/master/Variation%20partitioning/Occurrence_probability_matrix.xlsx)
contains a matrix of the predicted habitat suitabilities of seven oak species related to the corresponding environmental factors; TXT files are the results of variation partitioning for each species.

(b) [Ecological niche overlap](https://github.com/optiforziyan/Oak_Liao_et_al_2020_AFS/tree/master/Ecological%20niche%20overlap). The environmental niches of the seven sympatric oak species were described and compared from occurrence and environmental data using the framework in Broennimann et al. (2011). All the codes and data for ecological niche analysis can be found in this folder.
