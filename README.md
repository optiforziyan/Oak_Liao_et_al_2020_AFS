# The potential distributions of seven sympatric oak species in the Hengduan Mountains of Southwest China: The importance of climatic vs. non-climatic drivers

## Description

[variation partitioning](https://github.com/optiforziyan/Oak_Liao_et_al_2020_AFS/tree/master/Variation%20partitioning) 
Variation partitioning for the predicted habitat suitability simulated by our ensemble models in terms of fractions of variation explained. Variation of the species data matrix is explained by three groups of explanatory variables: CLIM (climatic predictors), NCLIM (non-climatic predictors) and SPAT (spatial predictors), and U is the unexplained variation; a, b and c are unique effects of CLIM and NCLIM factors and SPAT variables, respectively; while d, e, f and g are fractions indicating their joint effects. 

Note: CSV files are matrixes of the predicted habitat suitabilities of seven oak species relation to the corresponding environmental factors; Docx files are the results of variation partitioning.
